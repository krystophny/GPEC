This page is a comprehensive reference for the sign conventions used
throughout GPEC. Understanding these conventions is essential for
interpreting outputs, interfacing with other codes, and correctly
setting up kinetic calculations.

Coordinate System
=================

DCON defines its native magnetic chart :math:`(\psi, \theta, \zeta)` and
Fourier decomposition :math:`\exp[2\pi i(m\theta-n\zeta)]` independently of
the physical machine embedding.  Do not infer physical handedness from this
abstract chart alone: GPEC maps its native toroidal coordinate to the
counter-clockwise machine angle using ``helicity``, as described below.

Poloidal Flux :math:`\psi`
--------------------------

- Normalized from 0 (magnetic axis) to 1 (plasma boundary).
- :math:`\psi_0 = \psi_{\mathrm{bry}} - \psi_{\mathrm{axis}}` is forced positive
  on read (``read_eq_efit`` in ``equil/read_eq.f``). If the EQDSK has
  :math:`\psi_{\mathrm{bry}} < \psi_{\mathrm{axis}}`, both :math:`\psi_0` and
  the 2D flux array are sign-flipped.
- Occasionally :math:`\rho = \sqrt{\psi}` is used as a radius-like variable.

Poloidal Angle :math:`\theta`
-----------------------------

- "Upward outboard" convention, always. :math:`\theta` increases by 1 (not
  :math:`2\pi`) going once around the poloidal direction.
- This is fixed regardless of helicity or working coordinate choice.

Toroidal Coordinate :math:`\zeta` and :math:`\phi`
---------------------------------------------------

- The ignorable toroidal coordinate is :math:`\zeta = \phi/(2\pi) + \nu(\psi,\theta)`,
  where :math:`\nu` is a single-valued function that depends on the working
  coordinate system. PEST coordinates have :math:`\nu = 0`.
- :math:`\phi` is effectively **CCW** (counter-clockwise from above) for
  left-handed (LH) configurations, but **CW** (clockwise) for right-handed
  (RH) configurations.
- In the laboratory convention where :math:`\phi_{\rm CCW}` increases
  counter-clockwise viewed from above, the implemented machine embedding is
  :math:`\phi_{\rm CCW}=-h(2\pi\zeta+\delta\phi)`, with
  :math:`h=\mathrm{helicity}` (``coil/field.F``).

Working Coordinate Options
--------------------------

Controlled by ``jac_type`` in ``equil.in``. The Jacobian is
:math:`J \propto B_p^{p_{bp}} \, B^{p_b} \, R^{-p_r}`:

Helicity and Handedness
=======================

Helicity is computed in the ``gpec_main`` program (``gpec/gpec.f``):

.. code-block:: fortran

   ipd = 1.0
   btd = 1.0
   IF(ip_direction=="negative") ipd = -1.0
   IF(bt_direction=="negative") btd = -1.0
   helicity = ipd * btd

- ``ip_direction`` and ``bt_direction`` are set in ``coil.in``.
  "positive" means CCW viewed from above; "negative" means CW.
- **helicity = +1**: right-handed (RH), :math:`B_t` and :math:`I_p` in the
  same direction.
- **helicity = -1**: left-handed (LH), :math:`B_t` and :math:`I_p` opposed.
- The helicity value is stored in the ``gpec_control_output`` netcdf file.


:math:`F = R B_\phi`
=====================

The poloidal-current function :math:`F = R B_\phi` from the Grad-Shafranov
equation is **forced positive** via ``ABS()`` (``read_eq_efit`` in
``equil/read_eq.f``):

.. code-block:: fortran

   sq_in%fs(:,1) = ABS(sq_in%fs(:,1))

The code always works with :math:`|F|`. Any information about the sign of
:math:`B_t` must come from the ``bt_direction`` setting in ``coil.in``.


Safety Factor :math:`q`
========================

- Defined as :math:`q = (\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla\zeta) / (\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla\theta)`.
- **Recomputed, not read.** For direct equilibria (EFIT g-files), the q
  profile in the file is read but never used. ``direct_run`` in
  ``equil/direct.f`` rebuilds q on each flux surface from a field-line
  integration.
- **Always positive for g-file input.** The integration uses the
  sign-normalized :math:`\psi` map and :math:`|F|`, so q comes out positive
  for any combination of signs in the g-file. Reversing all signed
  quantities in a g-file (:math:`\psi`, ``simag``, ``sibry``, ``cpasma``,
  q) reproduces the original DCON results bit for bit.
- Inverse equilibria (e.g. CHEASE) keep the q profile of the input file,
  including its sign (``inverse_run`` in ``equil/inverse.f``).
- ``newq0`` in ``equil.in`` rescales :math:`F` to set q on axis while
  preserving the Grad-Shafranov solution (``direct_run`` in
  ``equil/direct.f``). A negative ``newq0`` is the one way to impose
  q < 0 on a direct equilibrium.


Mode Numbers :math:`m` and :math:`n`
=====================================

Toroidal Mode Number :math:`n`
------------------------------

- Set as a **positive integer** ``nn`` in ``dcon.in``. GPEC runs one toroidal
  harmonic at a time; results for multiple :math:`n` can be superposed.

Poloidal Mode Range
-------------------

The poloidal mode spectrum spans ``mlow`` to ``mhigh``, computed in the
``dcon`` program (``dcon/dcon.F``):

.. code-block:: fortran

   mlow  = MIN(nn*qmin, zero) - 4 - delta_mlow
   mhigh = nn*qmax + delta_mhigh

``delta_mlow`` and ``delta_mhigh`` (set in ``dcon.in``) widen the range
beyond the resonant modes.

Why Positive :math:`m` Is Always Resonant
-----------------------------------------

Resonant surfaces are found by ``sing_find`` in ``dcon/sing.f``.
It performs a binary search for flux surfaces where :math:`m = n \cdot q`.
Since :math:`n > 0` (by convention) and :math:`q > 0` (guaranteed for
direct equilibria, see the safety factor section above):

.. math::

   m_{\mathrm{res}} = \mathrm{NINT}(n \cdot q) > 0

**Resonant modes always have positive** :math:`m`. Negative-:math:`m` modes
are always non-resonant. This is by design: one can always plot the
:math:`m = 2` displacement profile and see resonant behavior at :math:`q = 2`,
while :math:`m = -2` is always non-resonant.


Spectrum Output Sign Conventions
================================

Real-Space Output
-----------------

For the real-space representation decomposed in :math:`\exp(-in\phi)` with
CCW :math:`\phi`, GPEC takes the complex conjugate for RH configurations.
This is implemented throughout ``gpec/gpout.f`` as:

.. code-block:: fortran

   -helicity * AIMAG(quantity)

For the full Fourier representation :math:`\exp(im\theta - in\phi)`, the
conjugate operation also flips up and down (not just the toroidal direction).

Interfacing with SURFMN
-----------------------

SURFMN expands in :math:`\exp(-im\theta - in\phi)` and always uses CCW
:math:`\phi`. To convert:

.. code-block:: python

   m_surfmn = helicity * m_gpec
   b_surfmn = real(b_m) - 1j * helicity * imag(b_m)

For LH configurations: only the sign of :math:`m` is flipped. For RH: :math:`m`
is unchanged but the complex conjugate is taken.

Interfacing with VACUUM
-----------------------

The VACUUM code uses CCW :math:`\phi` and downward outboard :math:`\theta`.
GPEC uses the complex conjugate of RH configurations when interfacing with
VACUUM.


Rotation Velocity Conventions (PENTRC)
======================================

:math:`\omega_E` (E x B Rotation)
----------------------------------

- Column 6 of the PENTRC kinetic profile file: :math:`\omega_E` in rad/s.
- Read by the ``read_kin`` subroutine in ``pentrc/inputs.f90``.
- **Sign convention**: positive :math:`\omega_E` means rotation in the
  direction of the toroidal coordinate :math:`\zeta`.
- In the CCW laboratory frame, positive native :math:`\omega_E` has sign
  :math:`-h`.  Relative to plasma current its sign is
  :math:`(-h)/s_I=-s_B`, where :math:`s_I=\mathtt{ipd}` and
  :math:`s_B=\mathtt{btd}`.  It is therefore co-current exactly when
  ``bt_direction="negative"`` (clockwise), not according to helicity alone.
  For ``(ip_direction,bt_direction)=(positive,positive)``, positive native
  :math:`\omega_E` is clockwise and counter-current.

Diamagnetic Frequencies
-----------------------

Computed in ``read_kin`` (``pentrc/inputs.f90``) and ``tpsi``
(``pentrc/torque.F90``):

.. math::

   \omega_{*n} = -\frac{2\pi \, T_i}{e \, Z_i \, \chi_1 \, n_i} \frac{dn_i}{d\psi_n}

.. math::

   \omega_{*T} = -\frac{2\pi}{e \, Z_i \, \chi_1} \frac{dT_i}{d\psi_n}

where :math:`\chi_1 = 2\pi \psi_0` with :math:`\psi_0` the boundary poloidal flux.
The negative signs mean that a positive (outward-increasing) density or
temperature gradient yields a negative diamagnetic frequency.

Total Toroidal Rotation
-----------------------

.. code-block:: fortran

   wphi = welec + wdian + wdiat    ! tpsi in pentrc/torque.F90

The total toroidal rotation frequency is the sum of the E x B, density
diamagnetic, and temperature diamagnetic contributions.

Rotation Scaling Parameters
---------------------------

``pentrc.in`` provides two knobs:

- ``wefac``: direct multiplier on the :math:`\omega_E` profile.
- ``wpfac``: scales the total rotation :math:`\omega_\phi = \omega_E + \omega_{*n} + \omega_{*T}`
  by indirectly adjusting :math:`\omega_E`.

At the current revision, ``read_kin`` replaces every exactly zero
:math:`\omega_E` knot by :math:`10^{-9}\,\mathrm{rad/s}` before applying
``wpfac``.  Consequently ``wefac=0,wpfac=1`` is not an exact zero control.
This behavior is tracked in `issue 275
<https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/GPEC/issues/275>`_.

Energy Integral Resonance
-------------------------

In the PENTRC energy integral (``xintgrnd`` in ``pentrc/energy.f90``), the
resonance denominator involves:

.. math::

   n \omega_E + \ell_{\mathrm{eff}} \omega_b \sqrt{x} + n \omega_D x

where :math:`\omega_b` is the bounce frequency divided by :math:`x`,
:math:`\omega_D` is the magnetic precession frequency,
:math:`\ell_{\mathrm{eff}} = \ell + \sigma n q` is the effective bounce harmonic,
and :math:`x = E/T` is the normalized energy. The sign of :math:`\omega_E`
determines the direction of resonance in velocity space.


COCOS Compatibility
===================

GPEC does **not** use or reference the COCOS (Coordinate Convention Standard)
system. The conventions described in this document are GPEC-native and predate
COCOS. Users interfacing with COCOS-aware codes must manually translate between
conventions.

For g-file input the sign part of the COCOS choice cannot matter:
``read_eq_efit`` sign-normalizes the :math:`\psi` map, forces
:math:`F > 0`, and discards the file's q profile, so g-files that differ
only in sign conventions produce identical results. Field and current
directions enter solely through ``ip_direction`` and ``bt_direction`` in
``coil.in``. What does matter is the flux normalization: GPEC assumes the
g-eqdsk standard of poloidal flux per radian (Wb/rad). A file carrying the
full flux (the COCOS 11-18 family) yields a wrong q magnitude. Reports
that g-files must be supplied in one specific COCOS trace to this unit
requirement, since the sign choices are normalized away on read.
